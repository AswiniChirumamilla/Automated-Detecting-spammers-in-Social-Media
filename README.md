Automated Spammer Detection in Social Media

Overview
This project is a "web-based automated system" designed to detect spammers in social media platforms using *J2EE, Apache Tomcat, and SQL*. It leverages *machine learning* algorithms to analyze user activity patterns and flag potential spam accounts for administrative review.

ðŸ”¹Features
- User Authentication: Secure login for admin users.
- Data Preprocessing: Cleans and normalizes user activity data.
- Feature Extraction: Analyzes posting frequency, duplicate content, and engagement.
- ML-Based Classification: Identifies spammer accounts using trained models.
- Database Updates & Alerts: Flags spammer accounts and notifies admin.
- Admin Review Panel: Allows banning or warning of flagged users.

ðŸ”¹Tech Stack
- Backend: J2EE (Servlets, JSP)
- Server: Apache Tomcat
- Database: MySQL / PostgreSQL
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (JSP-based UI)
